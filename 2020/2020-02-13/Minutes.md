### Current developments
- Discussion on how to fix [cppTango#401](https://github.com/tango-controls/cppTango/issues/401). 
In particular, what should we do if a user wants to change the max value attribute property of a memorized attribute and when the new max value is below the current attribute set point (which is memorized)?

### Conda packages

Reynald got in touch with Tiago who provided the links to the gitlab repository where the conda recipe is present.
Reynald suggests to store the conda recipes on tango-controls github organization and to create more conda packages with a finer granularity.
For instance, one package with only the tango c++ library, one package for the Tango starter, etc...

### TangoTest improvements 

The 2 open issues from TangoTest repositories have been addressed in some Pull Requests by Thomas Braun (byte physics) 
and Katarzyna RzÄ™sikowska (S2Innovation). They now need to be reviewed and approved.

### Next teleconf meeting

Tango kernel teleconf meetings take place on the 2nd and 4th Thursday of each month, at 15:00 CET (Paris time).

The next Tango kernel teleconf meeting will take place in 2 weeks on Thursday 27th February 2020 at 15:00 CET.
