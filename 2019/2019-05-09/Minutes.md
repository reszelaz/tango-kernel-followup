# Minutes

## cppTango News

cppTango 9.3.3 has been installed on the ESRF accelerator simulators control systems and on the control system being built for the new accelerator.

No big issue reported so far.

Elettra tested it and improvements were noticed compared to the previous version.

cppTango 9.3.3 is also used in the latest TangoBox. No problem detected when using 9.3.3 clients and servers.
Some problems were noticed when mixing 9.2.5 and 9.3.3. Reynald mentioned that this might be expected in some specific cases because the resolution of the event problems involved a fix on both client and server side.

**Action - ESRF**: Flag cppTango 9.3.3 as stable release and advertise it.

**Action - All**: Test cppTango 9.3.3 and provide feedback.

Some support contracts have been agreed with S2Innovation and BytePhysics (Thomas Braun) to provide some support on cppTango and Tango Source Distribution.

The administrative part will be completed soon. Piotr Goryl and Michal Liszcz from S2Innovation will come to the ESRF next week for a couple of days. They will leave with some homework.

Igor mentioned that he still has ~40 hours to be spent on cppTango. 

**Action - IK**: Work on server_init_hook() ([cppTango#498](https://github.com/tango-controls/cppTango/issues/498))

**Action - ESRF-IK**: Organize a teleconf with Igor to agree on the tasks to be done.

## sys-tango-benchmark

Piotr presented the new Tango Benchmark tools in a few words.

They are available on the following Github repository: https://github.com/tango-controls/sys-tango-benchmark.

**Action - All**: Users are encouraged to test the [sys-tango-benchmark](https://github.com/tango-controls/sys-tango-benchmark) tools before the next Tango meeting at Hamburg (beginning of June) and to provide feedback.

## Tango Source Distribution

9.3.3 release is being prepared in [TangoSourceDistribution#18](https://github.com/tango-controls/TangoSourceDistribution/pull/18).

Users can test it by using [prepare-9.3.3](https://github.com/tango-controls/TangoSourceDistribution/tree/prepare-9.3.3) branch.

Michal Liszcz has fixed [TangoSourceDistribution#21](https://github.com/tango-controls/TangoSourceDistribution/issues/21).
 He will work on [TangoSourceDistribution#30](https://github.com/tango-controls/TangoSourceDistribution/issues/30) and will try to update 
the automake files to merge liblog4tango and libtango libraries.
The next release will be available after this has been fixed (if it's not too long and too difficult to fix).

Some cleanup needs to be done in the README, INSTALL, TANGO_CHANGES and similar files.

**Action - S2Innovation**: Work on [TangoSourceDistribution#30](https://github.com/tango-controls/TangoSourceDistribution/issues/30)

**Action - All**: Users are encouraged to test [prepare-9.3.3](https://github.com/tango-controls/TangoSourceDistribution/tree/prepare-9.3.3) TangoSourceDistribution branch and to provide feedback.

## ICALEPCS TANGO Workshop

A TANGO workshop will be organized again at the next ICALEPCS in October in New York. 
We are looking for volunteers and ideas of contributions.

Piotr, Andy and Reynald mentioned they are volunteers.

**Action - ESRF**: Create an Indico page with a draft agenda for ICALEPCS TANGO workshop.

## JTango News

There is still an event reconnection issue on java client side in a specific case: [JTango#71](https://github.com/tango-controls/JTango/issues/71).
Pascal Verdier will look at it. We basically need to do what was done on the latest cppTango version on the Java side.

Igor is using his JTango fork. No big issue so far for the way he is using it.

**Action - ESRF**: Fix [JTango#71](https://github.com/tango-controls/JTango/issues/71)

## PyTango News

Tiago Coutinho is now back at ALBA.

Some work is ongoing in trying to do some automatic builds for Windows.

Jairo Moldes mentioned some problems with appveyor which is deleting some files.

Reynald mentioned that this should be fixed by using links to files which have been added by SÃ©bastien Gara to the [boost-ci github release page](https://github.com/tango-controls/boost-ci/releases).
These files links should be used instead of links to the appveyor artifacts (which are automatically deleted after 6 months).

## Waltz News

New releases with improvements concerning event notifications.
More details in the release notes of the following new versions:

* Release [v0.7](https://github.com/tango-controls/waltz/releases/tag/v0.7)
* Release [v0.7.1](https://github.com/tango-controls/waltz/releases/tag/v0.7.1)
* Release [v0.7.2](https://github.com/tango-controls/waltz/releases/tag/v0.7.2)

Igor will present these new versions during a talk at the next tango meeting.

**Action - All**: Users are encouraged to test latest Waltz version and to provide feedback.

## HDB++

Do we organize an HDB++ meeting this year? When and where?
Or do we go for some more regular teleconf meetings?

**Action - ESRF, Elettra, Alba, other institutes interested in contributing to HDB++**: Decide how to organize the next HDB++ meeting. To be discussed during the next Tango meeting in Hamburg.

Alba, Elettra and ESRF will work together on building and testing HDB++ benchmark tools in order to test the limits of HDB++ with the different supported backends.
The results will be published in a paper on HDB++ at ICALEPCS. 

## TangoBox status

TangoBox v9.3.3 has been released this morning (9th May 2019).
It has been prepared using [prepare-9.3.3](https://github.com/tango-controls/TangoSourceDistribution/tree/prepare-9.3.3) TangoSourceDistribution branch.

It is currently using a version of prepare-9.3.3 branch which is without the fix on Java logback file.
This fix will be added soon to the TangoBox.

The docker containers for the TangoBox are currently built at S2Innovation GitLab (with gitlab CI). See [the repository](https://gitlab.com/s2innovation/tangobox-docker/tree/master).

**Action - S2Innovation**: Add Java logback fix to TangoBox 9.3.3

The TangoBox is using many docker containers. These containers have been updated in order to use the latest tango version.

The size of the TangoBox has been reduced compared to the previous version.

**Action - All**: Users are encouraged to test the new TangoBox and to provide feedback.
