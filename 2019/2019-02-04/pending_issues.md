Purpose of this document is to organize the list of topics shared by each institute before the kernel meeting
in Krakow in February 2019. The issues have been presenting to everyone for discussion and then ordered 
by Sergi, Andy, Michael and the Solaris team.
 

Critical issues on tango
========================

- Make the new release of Tango 9.3 / PyTango 9.3

- Fix last known bugs in event system (IDL4 compat, DataReady and Pipe
events idl5_ prefix wrongly added)

- Add Changelog.md and improve Release Notes

ALBA:
- change/archive push event performance: could we have a single push_event with 
  - push_event(value, CHANGE|ARCHIVE mask)
  - integrate alba's pull request: [link]
  - with PR then change in core would be less critical

ALBA:
- Not possible to subscribe to events in server initialization phase #7
- Add server_init_hook() method #498
- Device server crashes on Windows when reading attribute in between its two
devices #19
- Tango Monitor problems on server startup #12

Python 2 vs Python 3: DevString with bytes -
 - https://github.com/tango-controls/pytango/issues/251 

Problems
========

- Fix bugs reported by sonarcloud and flag as false positive the false
positive (!)
- Improve the Travis tests

SKA:
 - PyTango, get unit tests passing on Travis CI again
 - testing client and server across different Python versions (e.g. 2.7
client with 3.7 server).

Forward attributes issues:
 - Add to docs Warning about forwarded attributes which are currently not reliable.
 
ALBA:
 - Not all messages from a DS are logged when launched from Astor #24

ALBA:
 - help needed for packaging Tango / PyTango in the future? 

ALBA:
 - event-subscriber not started despite of context=ALWAYS

HDB++:
 - data retrieval problems: Hint: Try SSD disks


PyTango: Study DS problem when using taurus 4 attribute (with serial mode)
 - How to reproduce:
 - PyTango device server.
 - Device creates a taurus device to some remote device and adds a listener.
 - Shutdown the device server cannot be killed anymore from Astor

 - Units: A string unit property is missing to for standard unit label
  - Tango Unitless vs not unit
  - Check if already done and document it

Documentation pending
=====================

 - improve the Contributions.md file from cppTango to give more details on
how to create a Pull Request.

- add an easy-access link to JTango javadoc in JTango documentation as
well as in the tango-controls documentation.

ALBA: HDB++ status:

 - mysql/mariadb divergence
 - myIsam/Aria/InnoDB comparison in cpu/disk usage
 - comments/results on JSON implementation for arrays

PyTangoArchiving:
 - how to correlate multiple DB's; switch DB based on date

SOLARIS: decentralization of the database 

 - document existing strategies; multiple tango_hosts, several device servers for same database, database replication
 - document proxysql usage from esrf
 
SOLARIS: archiving of huge amount of data, speeding up Tango

 - Define what is a huge amount of data; what are Tango limits
 - Write a HowTo/recipe for high event rate device servers (at alba we reach up to 400/500 events/s)

SOLARIS: data streaming for high speed detectors:

 - Tango is a control framework, very high speed image streaming may be out of its scope
 - But, would be good to document what is the limit
 
SOLARIS:
 - iot direction, mobile applications, how are we related? add a note to the main website
 
SKA:
 - get a better understanding of PyTango architecture

ALBA:
 - status of current Web applications: summarize what exists and status
 - Fandango / PyTangoArchiving / Panic documentation update ;
integration with tango documentation
 - Expand on debugging and testing:
 - https://tango-controls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/debugging-and-testing/index.html
 - Review of simulators documentation and examples (tango-simlib / simulatords)
 - Doc Tango source package creation. Missing deps. (Debian)
 
 - Tango Heart beat: how it works??

ESRF: 
 - add an advanced section on how to debug heartbeat pb with wireshark 

Enhancement proposals
=====================

Thomas Braun: 
 - using namespace: https://github.com/tango-controls/cppTango/issues/206 
 - Database with SQLite: https://github.com/ALBA-Synchrotron/pydatabaseds
 
MAX IV:
- CORBA alternative
- Run Tango on k8s (related to CORBA as well)

SKA:
Debian science gitlab pipeline for building PyTango deb packages for more OSs (Ubuntu 14, 16, 18)
https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/pytango 

SOLARIS:

 - database engine as plugin
 - simplification of C++ API (something like High Level API in PyTango)
 - transport protocols as plugins

ALBA:

- PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB schema?
 - Viewer/Extractor for multiple DB's? Correlate different DB's on java viewer or eGiga?

SKA: 

 - ability to set a different log level for each log target. This is
part of the SKA design guidelines. We need the same device to log
to 3 different targets, each with an independently configured log
level.
- support for vector of Enum (image?)
- support for complex data type (e.g. re,im)
- support for daytime datatype, with ms or us
- TANGO Attribute Alarms
  - support for configurable hysteresis in TANGO attribute alarms
  - Support TANGO Attribute alarms in additional State (e.g. RUNNING, MOVING, STANDBY...). Configurable list, backwards compatible?
  - add specific alarm_event
- profiling support, e.g. device server collects statistics about connections, events/s, commands, attribute reads....
- simulation support (device mockup)
- support for seamless integration of TANGO facilities: facilities federation?
- support for fully asynchronous TANGO device, e.g. firing events without polling (and coding)
- make logging sybsystem pluggable, support multiple concurrent plugins
- integrate support for VCS in TANGO DB (save to/load from git?)


Others:

- Tango library adaptation to work witch C#
