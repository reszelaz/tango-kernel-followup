This document summarises the outcomes of the Kernel and Doc Camp held at SOLARIS in Krakow in February 2019

**V10 way forward**

1. specify and define the Tango protocol using a formal specification language
2. define the minimum set of features to implement in a V10 prototype
3. design the prototype in a programming language neutral manner
4. an implementation of an evolutionary prototype with minimum functionality
5. Collaboration to invest more (up to 50% of budget) on V10

**cppTango 9.3.x**

**pyTango 9.3.x**

**continuous integration**

1. Added support for VS2017 on Windows
2. Decision was taken to stop support for MSVC9, MSVC10 and MSVC12. The builds for these MSVC compiler versions will be removed from appveyor. If some users still need to compile cppTango using these compilers, they will need to fork cppTango and maintain a version compatible with these old compilers.
